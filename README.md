# 1980 What What: Fixes the 1980 zip error

# About:
Here comes another useless addon that for whatever conservative reason is not included as part of Anki.

You will need this only when you run into this error:
```<class 'ValueError'>: ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980```

This addon auto updates the timestamp for the problematic media file(s), so you don't have to do it by hand.


### Full Details:
Full details of this error is described here:
https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop/35468  


### Warning:
In using this addon, you agree to have the timestamp of any media file with a mod time of less than 1980 to be auto updated to the current time. A message will be shown after the timestamp update.
